# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)



# 50.times do
# 	Project.create(
# 			name: Faker::Commerce.product_name,
# 			description: Faker::Company.bs,
# 			goal: rand(100000),
# 			deadline: "#{Faker::Business.credit_card_expiry_date}"
